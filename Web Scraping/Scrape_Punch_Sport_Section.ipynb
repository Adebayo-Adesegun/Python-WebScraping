The crisis took a new twist after the club’s chairman, Emmanuel Zira, was suspended by the state’s sports commissioner, Sanusi Farooq, with Abdulahi Abdulkadir appointed as acting chairman. Zira in an earlier interview with The PUNCH on February 15, 2021, had alleged that Farooq had sidelined him and taken over his job as the head of the club. Speaking with The PUNCH on Monday, Zira insisted that he remained the club’s chairman, adding that the commissioner didn’t have the powers to suspend him. “I am still the Chairman of Adamawa United and we are moving back to the Government House, though they are still working on it. I think by Tuesday (today) the governor will make the pronouncement. “The commissioner doesn’t have the capacity to suspend, people are just being misinformed. The fact that you are fighting with someone doesn’t mean you adjudicate the power that does not belong to you to yourself. It is only the governor that can sack me. “We are hoping that everything will be resolved because the governor has taken a decision, he has asked me to stop reporting to the ministry but directly to his office and we are only waiting for the modalities. “In the coming days, the news will come out as regards the real structure of how Adamawa United is going to be.” Permanent Secretary, Adamawa State Ministry of Youth and Sports, Aliyu Abubakar Jada, insisted that Zira had not been suspended. “Zira has not been replaced and he is the club’s chairman as far as I am concern,” Jada told The PUNCH. “If you say you suspended someone, you must give him a letter to show that he was suspended. But there was no letter in my office as regards his suspension. “There is an issue between him and the commissioner but by the procedure of the civil service I don’t think it is the right thing. I don’t want to comment much, but what I know is that he (Zira) has not been suspended.” Meanwhile, Abdullahi Abdulkadir told our correspondent that Zira remained a friend of the club but added that he was in charge of Adamawa United as the club’s acting chairman. He said, “The issue of Emmanuel Zira lies with the owner of the club, which is the government. “Just as Zira was employed, I was also employed too and those in the ministry are the ones to talk about his position. As far as I am concerned, he is still our colleague. I won’t say anything about it because I am not the one who made the decision. “I am the acting chairman at the moment and it may become permanent or not. Anything can happen but I won’t say much. “When the issue surrounding Zira is resolved, he will come back because nobody gives him a sack letter. Whenever the government feels he should return he will because I am only acting on his behalf.” Efforts by our correspondent to reach the sports commissioner to comment on the issue proved abortive. He didn’t pick our correspondent’s call, while he also didn’t respond to a text message sent to him as at the time of filing this report. Adamawa are bottom of the NPFL table after 13 games with just seven points.

James, playing in his 1,300th regular-season game, added six rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocked shots in just 24 minutes on court. He sat out all of the fourth quarter along with the rest of the starters from both teams as the Lakers closed out what had become a tough February with a dominant victory despite the continuing absence of star forward Anthony Davis. The NBA champions, who lost five of their first six with Anthony sidelined, have now won two straight. “When you lose a mega-piece like AD, it’s going to take some time both offensively and defensively,” James said of the adjustments required. James said the Lakers were becoming more comfortable in the roles they’ve had to adopt with Davis sidelined, an absence that Lakers coach Frank Vogel said called on them to develop a “little bit of a new identity.” Six Lakers scored in double figures as they avenged a narrow loss to the Warriors in January. James capped an overwhelming first half with a pull-up three-pointer that put the Lakers up 73-44. Eric Paschall led the Warriors with 18 points off the bench as star Stephen Curry was limited to 16. The end of the Warriors’ three-game winning streak was made more painful with departure of Draymond Green with a sprained left ankle in the second quarter. The Lakers’ win wasn’t even the most lopsided of the night. That belonged to the Memphis Grizzlies, who trounced the slumping Houston Rockets 133-84.

Tatum scored 31 points and the Celtics withstood a 46-point performance from Washington’s Bradley Beal to complete their first back-to-back wins since January. The Celtics trailed by five with 46.9 seconds remaining. Tatum cut the deficit with a driving finger-roll layup and with 4.7 seconds left spun and drove through traffic for the go-ahead basket. “Jayson’s will really shone through,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “It’s been a tough stretch for (Tatum), but this matters to him, he wants to win, and he made big plays.” It came down to the wire in Sacramento, where the Charlotte Hornets trailed by nine with 2:19 remaining but battled back to beat the Kings 127-126.
